# Graph-coloring

Implementations:

- graph-coloring-base.cpp: Is the base line implementation
- graph-coloring-imp-int: Is an improved version with the new data structure using integers as the data type.
- graph-coloring-imp-short: Is an improved version with the new data structure using shorts as the data type.
- graph-coloring-imp-full: Is the final improved implementation using all the techniques described in the report.
